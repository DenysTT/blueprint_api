System Diagram
-------------

.. image:: images/diagram.png
   :width: 1000

::

    * For QA/UAT instances only one Spotinst host will be used ($$$)
    * All infrastructure will be stored in Cloudformation/Terraform templates
    * I didn't display there CD hosts, GIT, LDAP and etc (which will be definetly present in real life)



No Downtime deploys
-------------------

::

    # 1) update ansible/inventory file with proper hosts ip's (in real case it might be autogenerated if ip is not uniq)
    # 2) export KEY="" (put proper .pem key path for hosts which will be provisioned)
    # 3) update blueprint_api_mongo_url variable in ansible/playbook.yml on the proper mongo host if it's not locally deployed
    # run the following command to trigger provision hosts
    $ make provision
    It will do the following
    - Hosts will be updated one by one
    - After updating one hosts post deployment tests will be triggered, and if tests fails deployment won't be processed
    further to second host
    * During update ELB or reverse proxy LB will decide where to route traffic (based on health checks) so if let say
    first host is updating and health check from this node is absent all traffic will be routed to host2
